## Auto-promoter/reattacher

- Reads from a list of bundle hashes and tries to promote associated transactions. In case it fails, reattaches them.
- Checks for confirmed transactions and remove them from the list of unconfirmed bundle hashes.
- Prepares a list of bundle hashes that fail to get promoted and reattached.
